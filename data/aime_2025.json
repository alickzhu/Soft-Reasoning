Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",
        "thought": "First, note that every value of $N$ up to 25 behaves correctly under the greedy algorithm (all solutions match the greedy solution). We then analyze larger values of $N$ by looking at patterns where the greedy algorithm fails.\n\n\\textbf{1. Initial Cases (\\(N\\le 25\\)):}\\newline\nAll integers $1\\le N\\le 25$ automatically work with the greedy algorithm.\n\n\\textbf{2. Identifying Failure Patterns:}\\newline\n\\emph{Example Failure Intervals:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\\(30\\le N\\le 34:\\) The greedy algorithm chooses one 25-cent coin plus $(N-25)$ 1-cent coins. However, a more optimal solution uses three 10-cent coins when $N=30$, or approaches 30 with fewer coins if $N>30$. Similar reasoning shows the greedy fails on $30,31,32,33,34.$\n\\item\\(40\\le N\\le 44:\\) The greedy algorithm chooses 25-cent + 10-cent + $(N-35)$ 1-cent coins, whereas the optimal solution is $4\\times10$ for $N=40$ (and similarly for $N>40$ up to 44). Thus it fails again on these five consecutive integers.\n\\item\\(55\\le N\\le 59:\\) The greedy would pick 25-cent + 25-cent + $(N-50)$ 1-cent coins, whereas the more optimal solution might be 25-cent + $3\\times10$ when $N=55$, etc.\n\\item\\(65\\le N\\le 69:\\) Similarly, the greedy fails on another five consecutive integers.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Observing a 25-Interval Cycle:}\\newline\nAfter $N$ reaches a value at which the greedy fails (e.g., $N=30$), it continues to fail on the next four integers, then \"resolves\" at $N+5$ (e.g., 35). The pattern reappears 25 cents later (e.g., fails again on $55,56,57,58,59$, then on $80,81,82,83,84$, and so on). In each block of 25 consecutive numbers, there are 10 numbers for which the greedy algorithm fails (two intervals of 5 each).\n\n\\textbf{3. Counting How Many Fail:}\\newline\nStarting from $N=1$ up to $1000$, the first failure block begins at $N=30$. The largest block that still lies within $\\le 1000$ begins at $N=980$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\\textit{Number of full cycles:} From 30 up to 980 is $(980 - 30)/25 + 1 = 39$ cycles if we include both endpoints. However, carefully checking the intervals:\n   - The standard approach is to consider $N=30$ as the start of the first cycle, $N=55$ as the start of the second, etc.\n   - The last full cycle that starts at or before 1000 begins at $N=980$, which is indeed $39\\text{th}$ if counting from $N=30$ as the $1\\text{st}$.\n   - Each cycle has 10 numbers on which the greedy algorithm fails.\n   - Hence, from $N=30$ through the entire cycle beginning at $N=980$, we have $39\\times10 = 390$ failures.\n\\item\\textit{Check up to 1000:} The block starting at 980 goes $980,981,982,983,984$ then resolves at 985, and fails again at $990,991,992,993,994$, then resolves at 995. All these fail values $\\le 1000$ are indeed covered within the same count of 10 per cycle.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTherefore, there are $390$ integers in $1\\le N\\le 1000$ for which the greedy algorithm fails. The total count is $1000$, so the number for which the greedy algorithm \\emph{succeeds} is $1000 - 390 = 610.$\n\n\\(\n\\boxed{610}\\)\n",
