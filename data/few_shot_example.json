First, observe that since $\\overline{BC}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{GH}$ (using angle chasing) and $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, it follows that $\\overline{CB}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{GH}$. Similarly, because $\\overline{AD}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{GF}$ and $\\overline{AD}$ is part of a diameter of $\\omega_1$, $\\overline{AD}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{GF}$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle GFH$,\n\\[\n(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 12^2 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x^2 + y^2 = 36.\n\\]\n\nLet $I = \\overline{GH}\\cap\\overline{CB}$. Then $GFBI$ is a rectangle (all angles are right), hence $FG = IB$. Moreover, $CI + IB = 2\\cdot15 = 30$. Since $IA = y$ and $AB = 6$, we get $CI = 30 - y - 6 = 24 - y$. Note that $CI$ is an altitude in $\\triangle CHG$, so its area is\n\\[\n\\tfrac12(2x)(30-2y) = x(24 - y).\n\\]\n\nNext, extend $\\overline{DA}$ beyond $A$ to intersect $\\omega_2$ again at $D'$. Since $\\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$ and $\\overline{BC}\\perp\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{BC}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{DD'}$, so $DA = D'A$. By Power of a Point, $CA\\cdot AB = DA\\cdot AD'$, and $CA=24$, $AB=6$, thus $(DA)^2=24\\times6=144$, giving $DA=D'A=12$.\n\nLet $J = \\overline{DA}\\cap\\overline{GF}$. Then $DJ=DA-AJ=12-x$.

Thus, we have \n$z \\left( z - 1 \\right) = b' x , \\hspace{1cm} (1)$ where $z \\in \\left\\{ 2, 3, \\cdots , b' \\right\\}$ and $x \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , b' \\right\\}$.\nNext, for each $b'$, we solve Equation (1).\nWe write $b'$ in the prime factorization form as $b' = \\Pi_{i=1}^n p_i^{k_i}$. Let $\\left(A, \\bar A \\right)$ be any ordered partition of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , n \\right\\}$ (we allow one set to be empty).

W.L.O.G., assume $c_1 < c_2$. Hence, we have \n$\\left( c_2 - c_1 \\right) P_A = \\left( d_2 - d_1 \\right) P_{\\bar A}.$\nBecause ${\\rm gcd} \\left( P_A, P_{\\bar A} \\right) = 1$ and $c_1 < c_2$, there exists a positive integer $m$, such that $c_2 = c_1 + m P_{\\bar A}$ and $d_2 = d_1 + m P_A$. Thus, $z_2=z_1+mP_{A}P_{\\bar A}=z_1+mb^{'}>b^{'}$.\nHowever, recall $z_2 \\leq b'$. We get a contradiction. Therefore, under each ordered partition for $b'$, the solution of $z$ is unique.\nNote that if $b'$ has $n$ distinct prime factors, the number of ordered partitions is $2^n$. Therefore, to find a $b'$ such that the number of solutions of $z$ is more than 10, the smallest $n$ is 4.\nWith $n = 4$, the smallest number is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 210$. Now, we set $b' = 210$ and check whether the number of solutions of $z$ under this $b'$ is more than 10.\nWe can easily see that all ordered partitions (except $A = \\emptyset$) guarantee feasible solutions of $z$.

            "Thought": "Let’s think step by step. Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\n\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is $n$ is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\n\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\n\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$.

            "Question": "Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\\]",
            "Thought": "Let’s think step by step. $ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ac(a+c)=300(ab+bc+ac)-3abc=6000000, 100(ab+bc+ac)-abc=2000000$\n\nNote that $(100-a)(100-b)(100-c)=1000000-10000(a+b+c)+100(ab+bc+ac)-abc=0$. Thus, $a/b/c=100$. There are $201$ cases for each but we need to subtract $2$ for $(100,100,100)$. The answer is $\\boxed{601}$.",

            "Question": "Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",
            "Thought": "Let’s think step by step. Let $w, x, y, z$ denote the number of residents who own 1, 2, 3, and 4 of these items, respectively. We know $w+x+y+z=900$, since there are 900 residents in total. This simplifies to $w+z=229$, since we know $x=437$ and $y=234$. Now, we set an equation for the total number of items. We know there are 195 rings, 367 clubs, 562 spades, and 900 candy hearts. Adding these up, there are 2024 items in total. Thus, $w+2x+3y+4z=2024$ since we are not adding the number of items each group of people contributes, and this must be equal to the total number of items. Plugging in $x$ and $y$, we get $w+4z=448$. Solving $w+z=229$ and $w+4z=448$, we get $z=73$.",

            "Question": "Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",
            "Thought": "Let’s think step by step. Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to $BC$ $a$ and $b$. Now we have the length of side $BC$ of being $(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b$. However, the side $BC$ can also be written as $(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b$, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have $\\frac{1190}{11} = a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side BC to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\\frac{4046+\\frac{1190}{11}}{\\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$, so we have $\\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\\boxed{197}$.",
