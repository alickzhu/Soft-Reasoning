  Question:
  It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16
  1. Thought: either walking or biking to and from work takes 2 hours + 2 hours = <<2+2=4>>4 hours. Walking to and from work three times a week takes 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours. Riding his bike to and from work twice a week takes 4 hours * 2 times = <<4*2=8>>8 hours. Total hours taken to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 12 hours + 8 hours = <<12+8=20>>20 hours. Answer: 20
  2. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18
  3. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours Total hours per day = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours Total hours per week = 6 hours * 5 days = 30 hours Answer: 30
  4. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work. 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 = 12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours biking. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours commuting each week.

  Question:
  The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800
  1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800
  2. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.

  Question:
  Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15
  3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3
  4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.

  Question:
  Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000
  1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400
  4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.

  Question:
  Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72
  2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72
  4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.

  Question:
  Find the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$.
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: . We have $17_b = 1\cdot b + 7 = b + 7$ and $97_b = 9\cdot b + 7$. For $17_b$ to be a divisor of $97_b$, we need $9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we get $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$. This simplifies to $9b - kb = 7k - 7$. Factoring, we have $(9 - k)b = 7(k - 1)$. For $b > 9$, $k$ must be less than 9. Testing values of $k$ that satisfy the equation and yield integer $b > 9$, we find that $k = 8$ gives $b = 56/1 = 56$, which is not valid since $b$ must be greater than 9. Testing further, we find $k = 2$ gives $b = 35/7 = 5$, which is not valid since $b$ must be greater than 9. Testing $k = 3$ gives $b = 14/2 = 7$, which is not valid since $b$ must be greater than 9. Testing $k = 4$ gives $b = 21/3 = 7$, which is not valid. Testing $k = 5$ gives $b = 28/4 = 7$, which is not valid. Testing $k = 6$ gives $b = 35/5 = 7$, which is not valid. Testing $k = 7$ gives $b = 42/6 = 7$, which is not valid. Testing $k = 8$ gives $b = 49/7 = 7$, which is not valid. Testing $k = 1$ gives $b = 14/8 = 1.75$, which is not valid. Thus, there are no valid bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. The answer is $\boxed{0}$. Answer: 0
  1. Thought: $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$, we can write these numbers in base $b$ as $1 \cdot b + 7$ and $9 \cdot b + 7$, respectively. For $17_b$ to divide $97_b$, we need $1 \cdot b + 7$ to divide $9 \cdot b + 7$. This gives us the equation $b + 7 = k(9b + 7)$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging this equation, we get $b(1 - 9k) = 0$, which implies $b = 9k$. Since $b > 9$, $k$ must be greater than $1$. The smallest possible value for $k$ is $2$, which gives $b = 18$. Checking this value, we find that $17_{18} = 33$ and $97_{18} = 175$, and indeed $33$ divides $175$. There are no other values of $b$ that satisfy the condition and are greater than $9$, so the sum of all such bases is $\boxed{18}$. Answer: 18
  2. Thought: $17_b = 1\cdot b + 7$ and $97_b = 9\cdot b + 7$. We need $17_b$ to divide $97_b$, so $9b + 7 = k(1b + 7)$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we get $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$. Solving for $b$, we find $b(9-k) = 7(k-1)$, implying $b = \frac{7(k-1)}{9-k}$. For $b > 9$, we look for integer solutions to this equation. Testing values of $k$ that satisfy $9-k < k-1$ (to ensure $b > 9$), we find that $k = 10$ and $k = 11$ yield $b = 70$ and $b = 77$, respectively. Thus, the sum of all such bases $b$ is $70 + 77 = \boxed{147}$. Answer: 147
  3. Thought: the equation $17_b = 1b + 7$ and $97_b = 9b + 7$. We want $1b + 7$ to divide $9b + 7$. Subtracting $b + 7$ from $9b + 7$ gives $8b$. Therefore, $1b + 7$ must divide $8b$. This is only possible if $b$ is a multiple of $8$. The smallest multiple of $8$ greater than $9$ is $16$, and the next is $24$. Testing these, we find that $16$ works, but $24$ does not. Therefore, the sum of all bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$ is $\boxed{16}$. Answer: 16
  4. Thought: to the equation $17_b = 1\cdot b + 7$ and $97_b = 9\cdot b + 7$. We want $17_b$ to divide $97_b$, so $1\cdot b + 7 | 9\cdot b + 7$. Subtracting $7$ from both sides, we get $1\cdot b | 9\cdot b$. This is always true for any base $b$, but we need to find the bases for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$.  To find these bases, we look for $b$ such that $1\cdot b + 7$ divides $9\cdot b + 7$. This simplifies to finding $b$ such that $b + 7$ divides $9b + 7$. By the Euclidean algorithm, we find that $b + 7$ must divide $9b + 7 - (b + 7) \cdot 8 = -56$. Since $b > 9$, we look for divisors of $56$ greater than $9$. The divisors of $56$ are $1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56$. Of these, $14, 28,$ and $56$ are greater than $9$. Thus, the sum of all such bases $b$ is $14 + 28 + 56 = \boxed{98}$. Answer: 98
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. We have that $a(b+7)=9b+7$ where $a$ is a natural number. Rearranging we get $(a-9)(b+7)=-56$. Since $b>9$, $b=49,21$. Thus the answer is $49+21=\boxed{70}$

  Question:
  The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a single scoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: , we can use the principle of distribution. We have 9 players and 3 flavors of ice cream. We know that at least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players choosing chocolate is greater than vanilla, which is greater than strawberry.  Let's denote the number of players choosing chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry as $C$, $V$, and $S$ respectively. We know that $C > V > S$ and $C + V + S = 9$. Since at least one player chose each flavor, we can start by assigning one player to each flavor, leaving us with 6 players to distribute among the three flavors under the given conditions.  We can use stars and bars to distribute the remaining 6 players among the 3 flavors, but we must ensure that $C > V > S$. To do this, we can consider the distribution of the remaining players as $(C-1, V-1, S-1)$, where we subtract 1 from each flavor to account for the initial assignment. This gives us a total of $6 - 3 = 3$ players to distribute freely among the flavors.  However, we must ensure that $C > V > S$. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to account for the restrictions. We can distribute the 3 players among the 3 flavors using stars and bars, which gives us $\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.  Next, we subtract the cases where $C = V$ or $V = S$. There are 3 cases where $C = V$ (with $S$ being the remaining players), and 3 cases where $V = S$ (with $C$ being the remaining players). However, we must add back the cases where $C = V = S$, which is not possible given our conditions.  Thus, the total number of valid distributions is $10 - 3 - 3 = 4$. However, this does not account for the initial assignment of one player to each flavor. Since there are 3! = 6 ways to assign the initial flavors, the total number of distributions is $4 \times 6 = 24$.  However, this calculation does not directly account for the specific conditions given. A more detailed analysis using generating functions or direct counting methods would be required to find the exact number of distributions that meet the conditions. For the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the detailed calculation would yield a number that, when divided by 1000, leaves a remainder of $\boxed{24}$. Answer: 24
  1. Thought: the number of players who chose chocolate, vanilla, strawberry. $c, v, s$ respectively. $c > v > s$ and $c + v + s = 9.$ We can use the stars and bars method to count the number of solutions to this equation, but we must also consider the inequalities. First, we can ignore the inequalities and use stars and bars to find that there are $\binom{9+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{11}{2} = 55$ ways to distribute the ice cream flavors without considering the inequalities. Then, we can use PIE to subtract the cases where $c \leq v$ or $v \leq s.$ There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways for $c = v$ (chocolate and vanilla have the same number of players), $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways for $v = s$ (vanilla and strawberry have the same number of players), and $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways for $c = v = s$ (all three flavors have the same number of players). However, we have double-counted the case where $c = v = s = 3,$ so we must add back $1.$ Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the ice cream flavors, considering the inequalities, is $55 - 15 - 15 + 6 - 1 = 30.$ Answer: 30
  2. Thought: . We have $9$ players and $3$ flavors. We can use the stars and bars method to distribute the players among the flavors, but we must account for the conditions given. Let $C$, $V$, and $S$ represent the number of players choosing chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, respectively. We know $C + V + S = 9$, $C > V > S$, and $C, V, S \geq 1$. We can subtract $1$ from each to ensure they are positive, giving us $C' + V' + S' = 6$, where $C' = C - 1$, $V' = V - 1$, and $S' = S - 1$. We need to find the number of solutions to this equation where $C' > V' > S' \geq 0$. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using generating functions or casework. For simplicity, let's use casework. The possible distributions for $(C', V', S')$ are $(4, 1, 1)$, $(3, 2, 1)$, and $(4, 2, 0)$. For $(4, 1, 1)$, there are $3! / 2! = 3$ ways to arrange the flavors. For $(3, 2, 1)$, there are $3! = 6$ ways. For $(4, 2, 0)$, there are $3$ ways. Thus, $N = 3 + 6 + 3 = 12$. However, this is a simplified version, and the actual problem requires a more detailed analysis. For the sake of this example, let's assume $N = 12$. The remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $\boxed{12}$. Answer: 12
  3. Thought: we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ways to distribute the ice cream flavors among the players. We know that at least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players choosing chocolate is greater than vanilla, which is greater than strawberry.  Let's denote the number of players choosing chocolate as $c$, vanilla as $v$, and strawberry as $s$. We have $c + v + s = 9$ and $c > v > s \geq 1$. We can use stars and bars to count the number of ways to distribute the flavors, but we need to subtract the cases where $c \leq v$ or $v \leq s$.  First, we distribute the minimum required flavors: $c = 3, v = 2, s = 1$. This leaves us with $3$ players to distribute among the flavors. Using stars and bars, we have $3$ stars and $2$ bars, giving us $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to distribute the remaining players without restrictions.  However, we need to subtract the cases where $c \leq v$ or $v \leq s$. Since $c$ must be greater than $v$ and $v$ must be greater than $s$, the only cases we need to subtract are those where $c = v$ or $v = s$. Since $c$ and $v$ cannot be equal (as $c > v$), we only need to subtract the cases where $v = s$.  If $v = s$, then $c + 2v = 9$. The possible values for $v$ are $1, 2,$ and $3$. For $v = 1$, we have $c = 7$, which is not allowed as $c > v$. For $v = 2$, we have $c = 5$, which is allowed. For $v = 3$, we have $c = 3$, which is not allowed as $c > v$. So, we only need to subtract the case where $v = 2$ and $c = 5$.  In the case where $v = 2$ and $c = 5$, we have $s = 2$. This leaves us with $0$ players to distribute, so there is only $1$ way to distribute the remaining players in this case.  Thus, the number of valid distributions is $10 - 1 = 9$. Since we are asked for the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$, and $N = 9$, the answer is $\boxed{9}$. Answer: 9

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Let $c$ be the number of players who choose chocolate, $v$ be the number of players who choose vanilla, and $s$ be the number of players who choose strawberry ice cream. We have $c,v,s\\ge 1$ and $c + v + s = 9.$\\newline\n\\newline\nBy inspection, the only solutions for $(c,v,s)$ are $(2,3,4),(1,2,6),(1,3,5).$\\newline\n\\newline\nNow we must choose which player gets which flavor. For the general case $(c,v,s),$ we choose $c$ of the $9$ players for chocolate, then $v$ of the remaining $9-c$ players for vanilla, and the rest must take strawberry. The formula is thus \\(\\binom{9}{c}\\binom{9-c}{v}\\).\\newline\n\\newline\nSumming,\\newline\n\\(\n\\binom{9}{2}\\binom{7}{3} + \\binom{9}{1}\\binom{8}{2} + \\binom{9}{1}\\binom{8}{3} = 2016.\n\\)\\newline\nWe have \\(2016 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{1000}.\\)\\newline\nHence the final answer is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).

  Question:
  Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$ inclusive, such that $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$.

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: . We have $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 0$. This implies $4x - 3y = 0$ or $3x + 2y = 0$. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$ gives us the integer solutions. For $4x - 3y = 0$, we have $y = \frac{4}{3}x$, and for $3x + 2y = 0$, we have $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$. Considering the range $-100 \leq x, y \leq 100$, we find the number of integer solutions for each equation. For $y = \frac{4}{3}x$, we have $x$ divisible by $3$ and $y$ divisible by $4$. For $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$, we have $x$ divisible by $2$ and $y$ divisible by $3$. Counting the number of such $x$ and $y$ values within the given range gives us the total number of ordered pairs. The final answer is $\boxed{134}$, considering both positive and negative values for $x$ and $y$. Answer: 134
  1. Thought: , we have $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(3x - 2y)(4x + 3y) = 0$. This implies $3x - 2y = 0$ or $4x + 3y = 0$. Solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, we get $y = \frac{3x}{2}$ and $y = -\frac{4x}{3}$. For $y = \frac{3x}{2}$ to have integer solutions, $x$ must be even, and for $y = -\frac{4x}{3}$, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$. Considering the range $-100 \leq x, y \leq 100$, we find the number of even $x$ values and multiples of $3$ within the range. For $y = \frac{3x}{2}$, there are $101$ even $x$ values from $-100$ to $100$. For $y = -\frac{4x}{3}$, there are $67$ multiples of $3$ from $-100$ to $100$. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is $101 + 67 = \boxed{168}$. Answer: 168
  2. Thought: $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ can be factored as $(3x+2y)(4x-3y) = 0$. This gives us two equations to solve: $3x + 2y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 0$.  For $3x + 2y = 0$, we have $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of $2$ and $y$ a multiple of $3$. The range for $x$ and $y$ is $-100$ to $100$. The number of multiples of $2$ in this range is $101$ (from $-100$ to $100$), and similarly for $y$ as a multiple of $3$, it's also $101$. However, since $y$ is determined by $x$, we only need to count the multiples of $2$ in the range, which gives us $101$ solutions for this equation.  For $4x - 3y = 0$, we have $y = \frac{4}{3}x$. This time, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$ and $y$ a multiple of $4$. The number of multiples of $3$ in the range is $67$ (from $-99$ to $99$), and for $y$ as a multiple of $4$, it's also $67$. Again, since $y$ is determined by $x$, we only need to count the multiples of $3$ in the range, which gives us $67$ solutions for this equation.  Adding the solutions from both equations, we get $101 + 67 = 168$ solutions. However, we must subtract the solutions that satisfy both equations, as they are counted twice. Since $x$ and $y$ cannot simultaneously satisfy both $3x + 2y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 0$, there are no solutions to subtract.  Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ is $\boxed{168}$. Answer: 168
  3. Thought: from the original problem, we have $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$. Factoring this, we get $(3x+2y)(4x-3y) = 0$. This implies that either $3x + 2y = 0$ or $4x - 3y = 0$.  For $3x + 2y = 0$, we have $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be even, and for every even $x$ between $-100$ and $100$, there is a corresponding integer $y$. This gives us $50$ pairs for $x$ positive and $50$ for $x$ negative, totaling $100$ pairs.  For $4x - 3y = 0$, we have $y = \frac{4}{3}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$, and for every multiple of $3$ between $-100$ and $100$, there is a corresponding integer $y$. There are $33$ multiples of $3$ in this range, giving us $33$ pairs for $x$ positive and $33$ for $x$ negative, totaling $66$ pairs.  Adding these together, we have $100 + 66 = \boxed{166}$ pairs. Answer: 166
  4. Thought: the equation $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ can be factored as $(3x-2y)(4x+3y) = 0$. This implies that either $3x-2y = 0$ or $4x+3y = 0$.  For $3x-2y = 0$, we have $y = \frac{3}{2}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be even. There are $100$ even integers between $-100$ and $100$ inclusive, so there are $100$ solutions for this case.  For $4x+3y = 0$, we have $y = -\frac{4}{3}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$. There are $67$ multiples of $3$ between $-100$ and $100$ inclusive, so there are $67$ solutions for this case.  Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ is $100 + 67 = \boxed{167}$. Answer: 167
   
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. We begin by factoring, $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = (3x+2y)(4x-3y)=0.$ Since the RHS is $0$ we have two options,\\newline\n\\newline\n\\underline{Case 1:}\\, $3x+2y=0$.\\newline\nIn this case we have $y = \\frac{-3x}{2}.$ Using the bounding on $y$ we get,\\[-100\\le \\frac{-3x}{2}\\le 100\\]\\[\\frac{200}{3} \\ge x \\ge \\frac{-200}{3}\\]\\newline\nAdditionally, in order for $y$ to be integer we need $2\\mid x,$ so substitute $x=2k.$\\newline\n\\[\\frac{200}{3} \\ge 2k \\ge \\frac{-200}{3}\\]\\[\\frac{100}{3} \\ge k \\ge \\frac{-100}{3}\\]\\newline\nHence $k$ ranges from $-33$ to $33,$ totaling $67$ integer values.\\newline\n\\newline\n\\underline{Case 2:}\\, $4x - 3y=0$.\\newline\nThis time $y=\\frac{4x}{3}.$ From the bounds we get,\\[-100\\le \\frac{4x}{3}\\le 100\\]\\[-75\\le x\\le 75\\]\\newline\nFor $y$ to be integer we need $3\\mid x,$ so let $x=3t.$\\newline\n\\[-75\\le 3t\\le 75\\]\\[-25\\le t\\le 25\\]\\newline\nThis yields $51$ integer values.\\newline\n\\newline\nFinally we overcount the intersection of the 2 lines (i.e. $(0,0)$), so we subtract 1.\\newline\nHence the total is $67 + 51 - 1=\\boxed{117}.$

  Question:
  It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16
  1. Thought: either walking or biking to and from work takes 2 hours + 2 hours = <<2+2=4>>4 hours. Walking to and from work three times a week takes 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours. Riding his bike to and from work twice a week takes 4 hours * 2 times = <<4*2=8>>8 hours. Total hours taken to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 12 hours + 8 hours = <<12+8=20>>20 hours. Answer: 20
  2. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18
  3. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours Total hours per day = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours Total hours per week = 6 hours * 5 days = 30 hours Answer: 30
  4. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work. 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 = 12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours biking. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours commuting each week.

  Question:
  The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800
  1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800
  2. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.

  Question:
  Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15
  3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3
  4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.

  Question:
  Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000
  1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400
  4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.

  Question:
  Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72
  2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72
  4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.

  Question:
  Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 3 times a day for 5 days is 3 * 5 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 times. Total times: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Answer: 27
  1. Thought: 5 days * 3 times/day = 15 times. 2 other days * 2 times/day * 2 = 8 times. Total times: 15 + 8 = 23 times. Answer: 23
  2. Thought: izer can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days: 5 * 3 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 times. Total times: 15 + 8 = 23 times. Answer: 23
  3. Thought: 5 days * 3 times/day = 15 times. 2 other days * 2 * 3 times/day = 12 times. Total times: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Answer: 27
  4. Thought: 3 times a day for 5 days is 3 * 5 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 3 * 2 = 6 times. Total times: 15 + 6 = 21 times. Answer: 21
  
  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. For 5 days, they ride 3 times a day, so each person rides 5 * 3 = 15 times. On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much: 3 * 2 = 6 times a day, so each person rides 2 * 6 = 12 times. Total rides per person in the week: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Since there are 2 people, total rides are 27 * 2 = 54 times.

  Question:
  Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 780786 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught means 4A. 13 less than that means 4A - 13. Stan has caught 5 more than Alex, so Alex has caught 4A - 13 - 5 = 4A - 18. Together they have caught 780,786 Pokemon, so 4A - 18 + A + (A + 5) = 780,786. 6A - 23 = 780,786. 6A = 780,809. A = 129,801. Stan has caught 4A - 13 = 4 * 129,801 - 13 = 519,204. Answer: 519204
  1. Thought: 780,786 = A + S + A.  A = Adelwolfe, S = Stan, A = Alex.  A = S + 5.  S = 4A - 13.  780,786 = A + S + A.  780,786 = A + (4A - 13) + A.  780,786 = 6A - 13.  780,813 = 6A.  A = 129,135.  S = 4A - 13.  S = 4 * 129,135 - 13.  S = 516,540. Answer: 516540
  2. Thought: 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught means 4A. Stan has caught 13 less than that, so 4A - 13. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so 4A - 13 + 5. Total Pokemon caught: 780,786. 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A = 780,786. 8A - 8 = 780,786. 8A = 780,794. A = 97,598. Stan has caught 4A - 13 = 4 * 97,598 - 13 = 391,382 - 13 = 391,369. Answer: 391369
  3. Thought: 780,786 = A + S + A.  A = Adelwolfe, S = Stan, A = Alex.  A = S + 5.  S = 4A - 13.  780,786 = S + S + 4S - 13.  780,786 = 6S - 13.  780,793 = 6S.  S = 780,793 / 6 = 129,132.5. Answer: 129132
  
  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. Let Stan's number be S. Alex has caught S + 5 Pokemon. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's number, so S = 4A - 13, which means Adelwolfe has caught A = (S + 13) / 4 Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught is S + (S + 5) + A = 339. Substitute A: S + (S + 5) + (S + 13) / 4 = 339. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 4(S + S + 5) + S + 13 = 1356. Simplify: 8S + 20 + S + 13 = 1356 ⇒ 9S + 33 = 1356 ⇒ 9S = 1323 ⇒ S = 1323 / 9 = 147.

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 320 more than 430 is 430 + 320 = 750. Maryam raises 400 more than Sarah, who raises 300, so Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700. Total money raised: 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2,180. Answer: 2180
  1. Thought: 320 more than 430 is 430 + 320 = 750. 400 more than 300 is 300 + 400 = 700. Total money raised: 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2,180. Answer: 2180

  Question:
  Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202
  1. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after she stopped jogging. So, before she started jogging, she weighed 211 - 62 - 140 = 9 kilograms. Answer: 9
  2. Thought: 1. Let’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. So, she lost 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms in total. 2. Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. So, she weighed 9 + 202 = 211 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 211

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 86 dollars for each t-shirt and 232 dollars for each jersey. 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys were sold. 254 x 86 = 21884 and 43 x 232 = 10016. 10016 - 21884 = -11868. So, a jersey costs 11868 dollars more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11868
  1. Thought: the Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. So, the total amount of money made from t-shirts is 254 x 86 = 21884. The total amount of money made from jerseys is 43 x 232 = 10016. The difference between the two is 21884 - 10016 = 11868. So, the difference is $ 11868. Answer: 11868
  2. Thought: 86 dollars for each t-shirt and 232 dollars for each jersey. 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys were sold. 254 x 86 = 21884 and 43 x 232 = 10016. 10016 - 21884 = -11868. So, a jersey costs 11868 dollars more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11868
  3. Thought: 86 * 254 = 21824. 232 * 43 = 9986. 9986 - 21824 = -11838. So, a jersey costs $11838 more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11838
  4. Thought: 86 * 254 = 21724. 232 * 43 = 9986. 9986 - 21724 = -7200. So, a jersey costs $7200 more than a t-shirt. Answer: 7200
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. The cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt is the difference in their individual prices. Subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey: $232 (jersey) - $86 (t-shirt) = $146 Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.

  Question:
  It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?
  
  Thought:
  2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16

  Question:
  The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
  
  Thought:
  5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800

  Thought:
  Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16
  1. Thought: either walking or biking to and from work takes 2 hours + 2 hours = <<2+2=4>>4 hours. Walking to and from work three times a week takes 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours. Riding his bike to and from work twice a week takes 4 hours * 2 times = <<4*2=8>>8 hours. Total hours taken to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is 12 hours + 8 hours = <<12+8=20>>20 hours. Answer: 20
  2. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18
  3. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours Total hours per day = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours Total hours per week = 6 hours * 5 days = 30 hours Answer: 30
  4. Thought: 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = <<2+2=4>>4 hours to walk to and from work. 2 hours to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = <<2+1=3>>3 hours to ride his bike to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 3 hours * 2 times = <<3*2=6>>6 hours riding his bike. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 6 hours = <<12+6=18>>18 hours to get to and from work a week with walking and biking. Answer: 18

  Question:
  The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800
  1. Thought: (2/7) * x = <<2/7*x=2000>>2000 x = <<2000*(7/2)=7000>>7000 Mike will have 2/7 * 7000 = <<2/7*7000=2000>>2000 After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 2000 - 200 = <<2000-200=1800>>1800 Answer: 1800
  2. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  3. Thought: 2:5 means that for every 2 dollars Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 dollars.  If Johnson got $2500, then Mike got 2/7 * 2500 = <<2/7*2500=714.29>>714.29 dollars. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 714.29 - 200 = <<714.29-200=514.29>>514.29 dollars. Answer: 514.29
  4. Thought: 5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800

  Question:
  Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  1. Thought: 115 Jamie’s last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. If Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, then it has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5
  2. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15
  3. Thought: 1st, Jamie’s last name is 4 letters long. 2nd, Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it is 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters long. 3rd, if Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would be 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 letters long. 4th, Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 letters long. Answer: 3
  4. Thought: 1. Jamie Grey has 10 letters. 2. Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, so it has 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 letters. 3. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, it would have 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 letters. 4. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 letters. Answer: 15

  Question:
  Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000
  1. Thought: The total amount of water is 2 liters = 2000 ml. The amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  2. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400
  3. Thought: 1 liter of seawater is 20% salt. So, 1 liter of seawater has 20% * 1 liter = <<20*.1=0.2>>0.2 liters of salt. Since Jack has 2 liters of seawater, he will get 0.2 * 2 = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 liters of salt. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, Jack will get 0.4 * 1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml of salt. Answer: 400
  4. Thought: 20% of 2 liters is 2 liters * 20/100 = <<2*20/100=0.4>>0.4 liters. There are 1000 ml in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 0.4*1000 = <<0.4*1000=400>>400 ml. Answer: 400

  Question:
  Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 8 ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  1. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is needed for each person. Since there are 12 people, 12*6 = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea are needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, 72 ounces of tea will make 72 cups of tea. Answer: 72
  2. Thought: 6 ounces of tea is 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of an 8-ounce cup. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9
  3. Thought: 12 people * 6 ounces per person = <<12*6=72>>72 ounces of tea needed. Since each ounce of tea is used for 1 cup, Artemis needs 72 ounces of tea. Answer: 72
  4. Thought: 8 ounces of tea is used for 1 cup. So for 6 ounces of tea, she will use 6/8 = <<6/8=3/4>>3/4 of the amount of tea. For 12 people, she will need 12 * 3/4 = <<12*3/4=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9

  1. Thought: 5 days * 3 times/day = 15 times. 2 other days * 2 times/day * 2 = 8 times. Total times: 15 + 8 = 23 times. Answer: 23
  2. Thought: izer can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days: 5 * 3 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 times. Total times: 15 + 8 = 23 times. Answer: 23
  3. Thought: 5 days * 3 times/day = 15 times. 2 other days * 2 * 3 times/day = 12 times. Total times: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Answer: 27
  4. Thought: 3 times a day for 5 days is 3 * 5 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 3 * 2 = 6 times. Total times: 15 + 6 = 21 times. Answer: 21

  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 50% more than the supplies means 1.5 times the supplies.  So, travel cost is 1.5 * $1,327,854 = $1,988,771. Answer: 1988771
  1. Thought: Let's think step by step.  The supplies cost $1,327,854.  The travel tickets cost 50% more: 1,327,854 * 1.5 = 1,991,277.  Total cost: 1,327,854 + 1,991,277 = 3,319,131. Answer: 3319131
  2. Thought: 50% more than the supplies means 1.5 times the supplies.  The supplies cost $1,327,854.  The travel cost is 1.5 times the supplies: 1.5 * $1,327,854 = $1,988,777. Answer: 1988777
  3. Thought: 50% more than the supplies means 1.5 times the supplies.  So, travel cost is 1.5 * $1,327,854 = $1,988,777. Answer: 1988777
  4. Thought: 50% more than the supplies means 1.5 times the supplies. 1.5 * 1,327,854 = 1,998,277.50. Answer: 1998277.50

  Question:
  Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 780786 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught means 4A. 13 less than that means 4A - 13. Stan has caught 5 more than Alex, so Alex has caught 4A - 13 - 5 = 4A - 18. Together they have caught 780,786 Pokemon, so 4A - 18 + A + (A + 5) = 780,786. 6A - 23 = 780,786. 6A = 780,809. A = 129,801. Stan has caught 4A - 13 = 4 * 129,801 - 13 = 519,204. Answer: 519204
  1. Thought: 780,786 = A + S + A.  A = Adelwolfe, S = Stan, A = Alex.  A = S + 5.  S = 4A - 13.  780,786 = A + S + A.  780,786 = A + (4A - 13) + A.  780,786 = 6A - 13.  780,813 = 6A.  A = 129,135.  S = 4A - 13.  S = 4 * 129,135 - 13.  S = 516,540. Answer: 516540
  2. Thought: 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught means 4A. Stan has caught 13 less than that, so 4A - 13. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so 4A - 13 + 5. Total Pokemon caught: 780,786. 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A = 780,786. 8A - 8 = 780,786. 8A = 780,794. A = 97,598. Stan has caught 4A - 13 = 4 * 97,598 - 13 = 391,382 - 13 = 391,369. Answer: 391369
  3. Thought: 780,786 = A + S + A.  A = Adelwolfe, S = Stan, A = Alex.  A = S + 5.  S = 4A - 13.  780,786 = S + S + 4S - 13.  780,786 = 6S - 13.  780,793 = 6S.  S = 780,793 / 6 = 129,132.5. Answer: 129132

  Question:
  Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
  
  Your previous answers:
  0. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202
  1. Thought: 9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after she stopped jogging. So, before she started jogging, she weighed 211 - 62 - 140 = 9 kilograms. Answer: 9
  2. Thought: 1. Let’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. So, she lost 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms in total. 2. Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. So, she weighed 9 + 202 = 211 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 211

  Question:
  It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?
  
  Your previous answers:
  2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work 1 hour to ride to work + 1 hour to ride back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work Walking to and from work 3 times a week: 4 hours * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours Riding to and from work 2 times a week: 2 hours * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours Total hours: 12 hours + 4 hours = <<12+4=16>>16 hours Answer: 16
 
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 2 hours to walk to work + 2 hours to walk back from work = 4 hours to walk to and from work. 1 hour to ride his bike to work + 1 hour to ride his bike back from work = 2 hours to ride to and from work. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so he spends 4 hours * 3 = 12 hours walking. Roque rides his bike to and from work 2 times a week, so he spends 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours biking. In total, Roque spends 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours commuting each week.

  Question:
  The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
  
  Your previous answers:
  5/7 of the profit went to Johnson, so 2/7 of the profit went to Mike. If Johnson got $2500, then the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $<<2500*(7/5)=3500>>3500. Mike got 2/7 of the profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $<<3500*(2/7)=1000>>1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800. Answer: 800

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. 5/7 of the total profit goes to Johnson, and 2/7 goes to Mike. If Johnson received $2500, the total profit is 2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike’s share is 2/7 of the total profit, which is 3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have 1000 - 200 = $800.

  Question:
  Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
  
  Your previous answers:
  Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters.  If Bobbie’s last name is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it has 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, Samantha’s last name has 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 letters. Answer: 5

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jamie Grey’s last name has 4 letters. If Bobbie’s last name, after removing 2 letters, is twice the length of Jamie’s, then it must have 2 * 4 = 8 letters after removing the letters. Therefore, Bobbie’s original last name has 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Samantha’s last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s, so it has 10 - 3 = 7 letters.

  Question:
  Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?
  
  Your previous answers:
  1250 ml of water evaporates, leaving 1000 ml of salt. Answer: 1000
  
  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and 20% of it is salt. 2 liters = 2000 ml, so the amount of salt is 20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 ml of salt.

  Question:
  Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?
  
  Your previous answers:
  ounces of tea for 1 cup, so 1 ounce of tea for 1/8 cup. For 12 people, she needs 12*(6/8) = <<12*(6/8)=9>>9 ounces of tea. Answer: 9

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Artemis uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup, so for a 6-ounce cup, she will use 6/8 = 3/4 of an ounce of tea. For 12 people, she needs 12 * 3/4 = 9 ounces of tea.

  Question:
  Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?

  Your previous answers:
  3 times a day for 5 days is 3 * 5 = 15 times. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days: 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 times. Total times: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Answer: 27

  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. For 5 days, they ride 3 times a day, so each person rides 5 * 3 = 15 times. On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much: 3 * 2 = 6 times a day, so each person rides 2 * 6 = 12 times. Total rides per person in the week: 15 + 12 = 27 times. Since there are 2 people, total rides are 27 * 2 = 54 times.

  Question:
  Jen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $1327854 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?
  
  Your previous answers:
  50% more than the supplies means 1.5 times the supplies.  So, travel cost is 1.5 * $1,327,854 = $1,988,771. Answer: 1988771

  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. The supplies cost $1,327,854. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies: $1,327,854 * 1.5 = $1,991,781. Total travel cost is supplies plus tickets: $1,327,854 + $1,991,781 = $3,319,635.

  Question:
  Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 780786 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
  
  Your previous answers:
  4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught means 4A. 13 less than that means 4A - 13. Stan has caught 5 more than Alex, so Alex has caught 4A - 13 - 5 = 4A - 18. Together they have caught 780,786 Pokemon, so 4A - 18 + A + (A + 5) = 780,786. 6A - 23 = 780,786. 6A = 780,809. A = 129,801. Stan has caught 4A - 13 = 4 * 129,801 - 13 = 519,204. Answer: 519204

  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. Let Stan's number be S. Alex has caught S + 5 Pokemon. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's number, so S = 4A - 13, which means Adelwolfe has caught A = (S + 13) / 4 Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught is S + (S + 5) + A = 339. Substitute A: S + (S + 5) + (S + 13) / 4 = 339. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 4(S + S + 5) + S + 13 = 1356. Simplify: 8S + 20 + S + 13 = 1356 ⇒ 9S + 33 = 1356 ⇒ 9S = 1323 ⇒ S = 1323 / 9 = 147.

  Your previous answers:
  2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs. 4-legged animals: 8,765,805 * 4 = 35,062,320 legs. Total legs: 20 + 35,062,320 = 35,062,340 legs. Pairs of legs: 35,062,340 / 2 = 17,531,670. Answer: 17531670

  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. Two-legged animals have 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Four-legged animals have 8,765,805 * 4 = 35,063,220 legs. Total legs: 20 + 35,063,220 = 35,063,240 legs. Total pairs of legs: 35,063,240 / 2 = 17,531,620 pairs.

  Your previous answers:
  320 more than 430 is 430 + 320 = 750. Maryam raises 400 more than Sarah, who raises 300, so Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700. Total money raised: 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2,180. Answer: 2180

  Analysis:
  Let's think step by step. Alexandra raises $430. Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. Total raised: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2,180.

  Question:
  Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
  
  Your previous answers:
  9 + 62 + 140 = 211. So, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms after 2 weeks of jogging. Since she weighed 9 kilograms initially, she weighed 211 - 9 = 202 kilograms before starting to jog. Answer: 202

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. The total weight lost is: 62 kg + 140 kg = 202 kg Her current weight is 9 kilograms. To find her weight before she started jogging, add the total weight lost to her current weight: 9 kg + 202 kg = 211 kg

  Question:
  The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?
  
  Your previous answers:
  95 school buses with 118 seats each means there are 95 x 118 = 11,270 seats. Since each classroom has students, the number of students is 11,270. Answer: 11,270

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. There are 95 school buses, each with 118 seats. To find the total number of seats (and thus the total number of students, assuming each student occupies one seat), multiply the number of buses by the number of seats per bus: 95 buses × 118 seats per bus = 11210 seats Therefore, there are 11210 students in the school.
  
  Answer:

  Question:
  The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
  
  Your previous answers:
  86 dollars for each t-shirt and 232 dollars for each jersey. 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys were sold. 254 x 86 = 21884 and 43 x 232 = 10016. 10016 - 21884 = -11868. So, a jersey costs 11868 dollars more than a t-shirt. Answer: 11868

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. The cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt is the difference in their individual prices. Subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey: $232 (jersey) - $86 (t-shirt) = $146 Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.

  Analysis:
  Let’s think step by step. Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets he used for toys than for clothes, subtract the number of tickets used for clothes from those used for toys: 12 tickets (toys) - 7 tickets (clothes) = 5 tickets Therefore, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.
